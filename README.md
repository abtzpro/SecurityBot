# SecurityBot
Sec mode GPT - A python script to pass all input through GPT 3 and into Sec or SecurityBot mode

a Python script that allows a user to activate chatGPT as "Sec" aka SecurityBot whenever they want. The script uses the OpenAI API and the GPT-3 language model to analyze and respond to security-related queries from the user.

When the script is running, the user can type "Sec" to activate Sec mode, which means that any input from the user will be treated as a cybersecurity-related query and passed to me for analysis and response. While in Sec mode, the user can type "Sec no!" to deactivate it and return to regular chat mode.

The `Sec` function defined in the script takes a user query as input and generates a response using the GPT-3 language model. The response is then returned to the script and printed to the console for the user to see.

The script is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to add additional functionality or customize the behavior of the Sec mode as needed.

The Sec mode and the training of the Sec AI were created by Adam Rivers, the CEO of Hello Security LLC. The Sec training algorithms utilize a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing, to improve my ability to analyze and interpret complex security-related information. The training process is iterative and ongoing, continuously refining and improving Sec mode capabilities through ongoing training and evaluation.
